## Project Description

### Financial data represents connections among multiple individuals and institutions in real world huge social network. Graph based data, with its adaptability, flexibility and agility, seems ideal for the complexity and flexibility of financial market and applications because it can simulate realistic transactions better compared with other format of data. Large numbers of efforts about machine learning and graph data that specialists put in engineering and biological applications have achieved significant breakthrough. These advanced models and algorithms will also be transferred to financial applications such as stock forecasting, risk prediction, recommendation system in e-commerce, fraud detection and so on. In this work, the application of neural network and graph data in financial research areas will be introduced and displayed by both theory and practice.
