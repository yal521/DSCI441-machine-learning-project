# Machine Learning Financial Applications: Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project Description

Machine learning models have already had significant development in engineering and biological applications. However, sometimes their accuracy and security are challenged by financial industry. At the same time, expensive failure cost and fierce competition provoke advanced machine learning models to be used in stock forecasting, risk prediction, recommendation system in e-commerce, fraud detection and so on. Recent years, 
graph-based data, with its adaptability, flexibility and agility, seems ideal for the complexity and flexibility of financial market and applications because it can simulate realistic transactions better compared with other format of data. In this research, we will focus on machine learning models used in credit card fraud detection and also exploration its new applications on graph-based models.

### Data Source
